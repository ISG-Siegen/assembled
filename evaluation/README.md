# Reproducing: Finding the Average Best 
To find the average best and produce the plots and results presented in the Appendix of the workshop paper, the newer 
version of Assembled has been used (see the main branch). 
Specifically, the code from the `experiments` directory in the main branch named Assembled-Evaler has been used. 
The Assembled-Evaler can also be used to produce the stripplots.
